Modelling of Shuttle Operation Specification of needs in our First Semester Work


1. Abstract
2.Introduction
3.Reliability of Shuttle Opreation
 i. Factors affecting the reliabiloty: - Trafic Characteristics
				     - Road Characteristics
				    -Bus Operation Characteristics
ii. Measures of Reliability: - Travel Time reliability
			    - Headway Reliability(the ability to maintain the existing schedule)
			   - Passenger Reliability, Trust and waitime for the next stops

4. Case Study: Kronach
	-Existing travel time presentation
	-Presentation of existing Stops and locations
	-Data collection and Analysis	
		i.Observed Travel Time for different roads in a specific period i.e Time VS Bus Stops
		ii. Observed bus trajectories along the test roads i.e. Time VS test Roads
		iii. Observed bus dwell time and number of boarding and alighting passengers at different bus stops of different roads i.e. Number of passenger VS time
	- Hypothesis test:
			i.Placement of stops highly impacts bus demand
5. Model Developement
	i. Calculate the dwell time between stops to find out the models average and observed time
	ii.Time VS Observed model average time and compare this to the real observed average time.
	iii. Test scenario 
6. Resulst and interpretation
